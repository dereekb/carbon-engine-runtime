 * `BLUELISTEVENT` - what happened to a Blue list.
 *
 * A list holds ONE observer (`IListNotify* mNotify`, installed with SetNotify)
 * and calls `OnListModified` on it. This is Carbon's wiring bus, not an event
 * system: the observer is the owner reacting to its own list.
 *
 * The first seven are events; the last three are flags OR-ed on top, so mask
 * with `BELIST_EVENTMASK` before comparing.
 *
 * Shared list producers and observers import this single declaration from
 * global/consts. IListNotify does not declare a separate BLUELISTEVENT static.

 * not the verb that takes it is implemented, and declaring it is what makes
 * the refusal reviewable rather than a blank.
