 * property the composed map feeds, what each channel of the file holds and the compositor operation that draws it.
 * A name outside the table throws; nothing is guessed.
 *
 * Sources, cited per entry:
 * - Property names: the character effects' texture parameters, `src/character/discovery/shaders.yaml` (DiffuseMap,
 *   NormalMap, SpecularMap and CutMaskMap are the same names in every character effect that samples them; the fur
 *   shells bind `colorize_head_l` directly as `LengthTexture`, :1024, which is mesh binding, not composition).
 * - Channels and blends: the shipped compositing effects under `res:/graphics/effect/utility/compositing/` (their
 *   per-channel placement, blit arithmetic and states).
 * - Families, regions and suffixes: the file names under `res:/graphics/character/<sex>/paperdoll/` (resource
 *   index, build 3670638): families `comp` and `colorize`; regions `head`, `body`, `hair`, `acc`; tiers `_4k`,
 *   `_512`, `_256` and none (`CjsCharacterTextureRoles.splitTier`).
 *
 * The parts library's one texture-role table (character-structure-and-plugins.md, "One role per manager": the parts
 * library is the only code that parses content paths). The entries below carry their sources. The map size tiers
 * and the `characterTextureQuality` setting live here too.
