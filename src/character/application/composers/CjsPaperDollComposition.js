/**
 * A paper doll's composition: every texture its targets compose, drawn the one way all of them draw. Each output is a
 * row: a target, a region and a channel, a base drawn first, then each part's layers in the definition's bake order
 * (`CjsPaperDollInstance` captures it as `order`), then the mip chain, then the output binds to its consumers. A row
 * draws into the other of its two targets each time, so a target its consumers still sample is never drawn into.
 * A row may draw its base into a region of the target only (`baseRegion`). The parts a row draws are a ready list the
 * paper doll hands over in the capture (`CjsPaperDollInstance.ready`: `lists`, by name; a row names its list, `order`
 * by default): the compositor decides nothing about parts and orders nothing.
 *
 * Parts give their layers through sources (`SetSource`), one per definition part: an object whose
 * `GetLayers(value, region, channel)` returns the `{ effect, region, writeRGBA? }` draws for a captured value, or
 * none.
 *
 * Ours (no Carbon counterpart): Carbon ships no paper doll; the client's is Python. The shape is the one in
 * character-structure-and-plugins.md R5 (composer-shape proposal, 2026-11-08); the name is a working name.
