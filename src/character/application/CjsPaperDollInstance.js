 * One built paper doll character: what was made from a definition. It owns
 * its target bindings (the prepared compositions, their targets and effects),
 * the skinned objects drawn for it, and the captured settings each target was
 * last built from. Nothing an instance builds is shared with another instance:
 * characters own their state until sharing is proven.
 *
 * `Update` decides what each target bakes and calls that target's binding only when it changed: it collects the
 * target's parts in bake order (`GetLayerOrder`), applies the bake rules (suppression, below) and hands the binding a
 * ready capture: each part's settings, `lists` (the ready lists the composition draws, `order` and for the head
 * `brow`), `suppressed` and `cyclic`. The compositor draws only those lists. Bindings are synchronous and run outside a
 * render pass.
 *
 * An application class; no Carbon
 * donor.
