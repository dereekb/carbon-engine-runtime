/**
 * The file shapes the character readers know: one value per shape, set on each record the reader makes
 * (`CjsCharacterRecord._pdpType`), so a record loaded anywhere still says which shape it was read from. Each
 * reader configuration names its kinds' values (`CjsCharacterLibraryConfiguration.kinds`, the character factory's
 * `recipeConfiguration`). `PART` is the parts library's join of a part folder, which has no file of its own.
 *
 * Ours (non-carbon-extensions.md § *The shared character library*; operator, 2026-11-10): the client's paper doll
 * is Python, so Carbon has no counterpart.
